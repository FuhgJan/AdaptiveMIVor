# AdaptiveMIVor
The Monte Carlo-intersite Voronoi (MiVor) adaptive scheme is an adaptive sampling technqiue for ordinary Kriging. 

The following library provides a Matlab implementation of the MiVor algorithm. For tests of the method three different test cases with different degrees of complexity are provided within this framework.


## Getting Started

We encourage those who are interested in using this code to run the main file and pick a test case.

### Prerequisites

Matlab version R2017a or higher.

## Examples 

We included three working examples similarly to what is found in the paper.
