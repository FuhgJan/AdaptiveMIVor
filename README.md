# AdaptiveMIVor
MiVor: An innovative adaptive Kriging approach for efficient binary problem classification of mechanical problems.

Kriging is an efficient machine-learning tool, which allows to obtain an approximate response of an investigated phenomenon on the whole parametric space. Adaptive schemes provide a the ability to guide the experiment yielding new sample point positions to enrich the metamodel. Herein a novel adaptive scheme called MiVor is proposed to efficiently identify binary decision regions on the basis of a regression surrogate model. The performance of the innovative approach is tested for analytical functions as well as some mechanical problems and is furthermore compared to two regression-based adaptive schemes. For smooth problems, all three methods have comparable performances. For highly fluctuating response surface as encountered e.g. for dynamics or damage problems, the innovative MiVor algorithm performs very well and provides accurate binary classification with only a few observation points.
